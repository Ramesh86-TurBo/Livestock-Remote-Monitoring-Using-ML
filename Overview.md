Traditionally, farmers are unable to pay enough attention to individual livestock. An increasing number of sensors are being used to monitor livestock behaviours, early health detection, and evaluation of animal welfare. In this project, the main focus will be on remote monitoring of livestock using machine learning technique. An accurate machine learning model will be developed, that will be used to identify multiple unitary behaviours of livestock, based on data collected by livestock sensor and later, anomaly detection will be performed for remote monitoring purpose. The project is divided into two phases, during first phase of the project, machine learning model will be developed for predicting the normal behaviours of the livestock. During second phase, anomaly detection mechanism for remote monitoring will be designed, that will be triggered if livestock is showing improper behaviour. Hence, farmer will be notified about this and will help him take necessary steps.
