Traditionally, farmers are unable to pay enough attention to individual livestock. An increasing number of sensors are being used to monitor livestock behavior, early disease detection, and evaluation of animal welfare. In this project, the main focus will be on remote monitoring of the livestock, machine learning algorithms will be used to identify multiple unitary behaviors of livestock recorded by livestock sensor and performing the anomaly detection.The project is divided into two phases, the first stage of the project will be development of the machine learning model for predicting the normal behaviors of the livestock.The second phase will be to designing anomaly detection for remote monitoring that will be triggered if something wrong happens with the livestock, farmer will be notified about this and it will help him take necessary steps.
