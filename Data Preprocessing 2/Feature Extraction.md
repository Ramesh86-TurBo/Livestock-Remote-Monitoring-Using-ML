1. **Using Raw Accelerometer Data (x, y, z):**
   - **Strengths:** The raw data gives you a direct measure of the acceleration in different directions.
   - **Limitations:** It doesn't inherently provide insights into patterns, periodicity, or the overall structure of the behavior. For instance, it might be challenging to differentiate between subtle differences in behaviors, especially when dealing with low-energy activities like standing or lying.

2. **Extracting Statistical Features (e.g., Mean, Standard Deviation, Skewness, Kurtosis):**
   - **Strengths:** Statistical features summarize key characteristics of the data distribution. Mean provides the central tendency, standard deviation indicates variability, skewness measures asymmetry, and kurtosis describes the shape of the distribution.
   - **Limitations:** While statistical features capture aspects of the signal's shape and stability, they might not fully capture dynamic or periodic patterns, which can be crucial for distinguishing certain behaviors.

3. **Calculating Frequency Domain Features (e.g., using Fourier Transform):**
   - **Strengths:** Frequency domain features reveal the distribution of signal energy across different frequency components. This is particularly useful for capturing cyclic or rhythmic patterns associated with specific behaviors. For instance, walking may exhibit a characteristic gait frequency.
   - **Limitations:** Frequency domain features might not be as effective for capturing static or non-periodic behaviors, and the choice of the appropriate frequency components depends on the characteristics of the behavior.

By combining statistical and frequency domain features, you leverage the strengths of both approaches. Statistical features provide a summary of the signal's overall properties, while frequency domain features offer insights into the signal's periodic components. This combined approach enhances the ability to discriminate between different behaviors and improves the overall understanding of the animal's activities.

**A] STATISTICAL FEATURES:**

1. **Mean (x, y, z):**
   - **Goal:** Captures the central tendency of the accelerometer readings.
   - **Explanation:** The mean represents the average value of acceleration along each axis. For example, a higher mean value in the z-axis during grazing might indicate a specific head-down orientation.
   - **Problem it Solves:** Helps identify the typical orientation or position associated with each behavior.

2. **Standard Deviation (x, y, z):**
   - **Goal:** Measures the variability or spread of accelerometer readings.
   - **Explanation:** Higher standard deviation values suggest greater movement or variation. For instance, during walking, you might expect higher standard deviations due to increased motion.
   - **Problem it Solves:** Distinguishes between behaviors with varying levels of movement.

3. **Skewness (x, y, z):**
   - **Goal:** Captures asymmetry in the accelerometer data distribution.
   - **Explanation:** Skewness indicates whether the distribution is skewed to one side. A lying behavior might have lower skewness, indicating a more symmetric distribution of acceleration.
   - **Problem it Solves:** Helps identify behaviors with distinct distribution characteristics.

4. **Kurtosis (x, y, z):**
   - **Goal:** Measures the tail heaviness or thickness of the accelerometer data distribution.
   - **Explanation:** Higher kurtosis values imply a heavier tail. Anomalies or abrupt changes in behavior might lead to deviations in kurtosis values.
   - **Problem it Solves:** Highlights behaviors with unique distribution tails.

**Differentiating standing and lying behaviour which are low activity behaviours:**

1. **Mean:**
   - For standing, you might expect the mean to be close to 9.8 m/sÂ² (standard gravitational acceleration on Earth) on the z-axis, while for lying, the mean could be close to 0, as the animal might be parallel to the ground.

2. **Standard Deviation:**
   - Standing, being a stable position, would likely have lower standard deviation in accelerometer readings (x, y, z). Lying might also have low standard deviation due to minimal movement, but the orientation might differ.

3. **Skewness:**
   - Skewness is about the distribution's asymmetry. For standing, you might expect skewness around 0, indicating a symmetric distribution. Lying might exhibit slight skewness if there's a subtle tilt.

4. **Kurtosis:**
   - Low kurtosis suggests a flatter distribution, which might be expected for both standing and lying. However, standing could exhibit a more peaked distribution due to the upright posture.

**Differentiation:**
- While some features may show similarities between standing and lying, the combination of these features across multiple axes and time windows helps capture nuanced differences. Additionally, feature engineering or introducing more features, such as frequency-domain features, can enhance the ability to discriminate between these behaviors.

**B] FREQUENCY DOMAIN FEATURES:**

5. **Spectral Energy (x, y, z):**
   - **Goal:** Describes the distribution of energy across different frequency components.
   - **Explanation:** Spectral energy helps identify dominant frequency components in the accelerometer signal. It might be higher during behaviors with specific rhythmic patterns, like walking.
   - **Problem it Solves:** Captures frequency-based characteristics of behaviors.

6. **Dominant Frequency:**
   - **Goal:** Identifies the frequency with the highest energy.
   - **Explanation:** The dominant frequency can reveal the primary rhythm or pattern in the accelerometer signal. For example, during grazing, there might be a characteristic frequency associated with chewing or head movements.
   - **Problem it Solves:** Provides insight into the dominant frequency component.

**C] ADDITIONAL FEATURES:**

7. **Signal Entropy:**
   - **Goal:** Measures the randomness or predictability of the accelerometer signal.
   - **Explanation:** Higher entropy suggests greater unpredictability. Anomalous behaviors might exhibit changes in entropy due to irregular patterns.
   - **Problem it Solves:** Detects behaviors with unpredictable accelerometer patterns.

8. **Signal Energy:**
   - **Goal:** Captures the overall intensity of the accelerometer signal.
   - **Explanation:** Signal energy provides a measure of the signal's overall strength or magnitude. Unusual behaviors might result in variations in energy levels.
   - **Problem it Solves:** Highlights changes in overall signal intensity.

9. **Prediction Error:**
   - **Goal:** Obtained from a machine learning model (e.g., autoencoder). Reflects the difference between the actual and predicted signals.
   - **Explanation:** A prediction error feature helps capture deviations from expected patterns learned by the model. Anomalies might result in higher prediction errors.
   - **Problem it Solves:** Enhances anomaly detection by incorporating machine learning-based features.
