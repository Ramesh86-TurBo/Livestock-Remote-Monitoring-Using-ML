this is the raw data on which  the data pre-processing will be applied to get a dataset suitable for model training. Data pre-processing is crucial to enhance the quality of raw data by addressing inconsistencies, missing values, and outliers. It ensures data reliability, improves model performance, and facilitates accurate analysis by creating a clean, standardized dataset for machine learning algorithms to yield meaningful insights.
