Outliers in machine learning are data points that significantly differ from the majority of the dataset. They can distort the model's training process and lead to inaccurate predictions. Removing outliers is often done to improve model performance by preventing these extreme values from influencing the learning process and skewing results. It helps in creating a more robust and generalizable model.

there are many methods to remove outliers, we will be using z-score method

**Z-score:**

The Z-score method is a statistical technique used to identify and potentially remove outliers in a dataset. It quantifies how far a data point is from the mean of the dataset in terms of standard deviations. By setting a threshold, you can identify and flag or remove data points that fall outside a certain range.

Here's how the Z-score method works and how it helps in removing outliers:

1. **Calculate Z-Score for Each Data Point:**
   - For each data point \(X\) in the dataset, calculate the Z-Score using the formula:
     \[ Z = \frac{{X - \mu}}{{\sigma}} \]
   - Here, \(\mu\) is the mean of the dataset, and \(\sigma\) is the standard deviation.

2. **Set a Threshold:**
   - Choose a threshold value (commonly \(2\) or \(3\) standard deviations from the mean) beyond which data points are considered as outliers.

3. **Identify Outliers:**
   - Data points with Z-Scores beyond the chosen threshold are considered outliers.

4. **Remove or Flag Outliers:**
   - Depending on the application, outliers can be removed from the dataset or flagged for further investigation.

**Example:**

Consider the dataset: \(\{2, 4, 5, 7, 10, 100\}\).

1. Calculate mean (\(\mu\)) and standard deviation (\(\sigma\)).
2. Compute Z-Score for each data point.
3. Set a threshold (e.g., \(2\) standard deviations).

\[ Z = \frac{{X - \text{{mean}}}}{{\text{{standard deviation}}}} \]

If the threshold is set to \(2\), the Z-Score for \(100\) would be significantly higher than \(2\), and it might be considered an outlier. You can then choose to remove or flag it.

Removing outliers based on Z-Score helps in creating a cleaner dataset, reducing the impact of extreme values on statistical analyses or machine learning models. However, it's important to carefully consider the context and potential impact on the overall dataset before deciding to remove outliers.
