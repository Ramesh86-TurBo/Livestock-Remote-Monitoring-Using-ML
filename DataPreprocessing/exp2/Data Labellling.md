**Theory:**

The chosen behaviors—lying, standing, grazing, and walking—align with my dual goals of predicting routine cattle behavior and detecting anomalies. These classes cover essential activities, focusing on lying and standing for effective anomaly detection with limited resources. This streamlined approach ensures practical data collection and supports a targeted classification model for efficient livestock monitoring.

1. **Lying:**
   - **Description:** This behavior occurs when the cow is resting on the ground, typically characterized by minimal movement. It may include eating or ruminating while lying and sleeping. 
   - **Reason for Selection:** Lying behavior is an essential indicator of the cow's resting state, often associated with periods of rumination and relaxation.

2. **Standing:**
   - **Description:** The cow is in an upright position with little to no movement. It may inlcude ruminating while standing or eating while standing.
   - **Reason for Selection:** Standing is a baseline behavior, indicating alertness or engagement without significant locomotion.

3. **Grazing:**
   - **Description:** Grazing involves the cow actively feeding on pasture or forage, characterized by rhythmic movements and moderate activity.
   - **Reason for Selection:** Grazing behavior is a vital aspect of a cow's daily routine, reflecting its feeding habits and nutritional intake.

4. **Walking:**
   - **Description:** Walking occurs when the cow is in motion but not at a high-speed or running.
   - **Reason for Selection:** Walking behavior is a more dynamic activity, indicating the cow is moving from one location to another. It adds a layer of mobility to the dataset.

**Reasoning Behind the Selection:**

   - **Practical Observation:** These behaviors are commonly observed in daily cattle activities, making them feasible to capture.theory
   - **Resource Constraints:** Given the limited resources and battery life, focusing on a smaller set of behaviors is practical for effective data collection and model training.
   - **Relevance to Health Monitoring:** These behaviors are indicative of the cow's overall health, providing insights into rest, alertness, feeding, and mobility.
